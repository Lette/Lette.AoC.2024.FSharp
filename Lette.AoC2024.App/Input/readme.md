# Advent of Code Inputs

## Structure

Each day of AoC has a single input, with the same input for both parts of that day.

Put your puzzle inputs in this folder, with one file per puzzle input.

Name the inputs `DayNN.txt` where `NN` is the day, left-padded with a zero for the first nine days.

## IP considerations

The inputs should not be added to version control, since the AoC author requests that the inputs aren't shared publicly for intellectual property reasons.([twitter])([reddit])

For this reason, a separate `.gitignore` has been set up in this folder that ignores everything, except this `readme.md` and the `.gitignore` itself.
